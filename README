Right now this is a basic SpringMVC app that uses the Google Geocoding API and Twitter API to find tweets near a specific region.

TODOS:
# Have an autocomplete for address
# Let the user specify the radius
# Make the UI look cool
# Show a google Map of the location with tweets marked up on the map
